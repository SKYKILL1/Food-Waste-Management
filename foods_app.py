    This project helps manage surplus food and reduce wastage by connecting providers with those in need.
    
    - **Providers:** Restaurants, households, and businesses list surplus food.  
    - **Receivers:** NGOs and individuals claim available food.  
    - **Geolocation:** Helps locate nearby food.  
    - **SQL Analysis:** Powerful insights using SQL queries.
