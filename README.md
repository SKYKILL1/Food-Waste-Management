A comprehensive platform to reduce food waste by connecting food providers with receivers in local communities.


üç≤ Overview

The Food Wastage Management System is designed to tackle the critical issue of food waste by creating an efficient marketplace where surplus food from providers (restaurants, grocery stores, households) can be claimed by receivers (NGOs, shelters, individuals in need). This system helps reduce environmental impact while addressing food insecurity in local communities.
